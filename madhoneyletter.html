To the Honorable Members of [State Legislature or U.S. Congress]:

As a concerned [parent / healthcare professional / citizen], I am writing to urge you to ban or strictly regulate the sale of so-called ‚Äúmad honey,‚Äù an imported product containing grayanotoxins derived from rhododendron nectar. This substance is sold online and in stores as a natural tonic for energy or libido but can cause serious cardiac and neurologic poisoning.

‚∏ª

<b>What Mad Honey Is</b>

‚ÄúMad honey,‚Äù also known as wild honey, is produced from rhododendron flowers containing grayanotoxins. While sometimes used in traditional medicine, it has no recognized therapeutic value and is potentially lethal. Even a small spoonful can cause bradycardia, severe hypotension, nausea, vomiting, and loss of consciousness. Emergency rooms around the world have reported patients collapsing within minutes of ingestion.

‚∏ª

<b>Documented Medical Harms</b>

‚Ä¢ Hundreds of cases of grayanotoxin poisoning have been reported in Asia, the Middle East, and increasingly the United States.  
‚Ä¢ Systematic reviews of over 1,000 cases show common symptoms of severe dizziness, fainting, vomiting, and dangerously slow heart rates.  
‚Ä¢ Case reports describe patients requiring IV fluids, cardiac monitoring, and atropine to restore heart function.  
‚Ä¢ Recent U.S. imports and online sales have led to poisonings treated by poison centers and hospitals.  
‚Ä¢ Deaths have occurred from heart block and respiratory arrest in otherwise healthy adults.  

‚∏ª

<b>Why Action Is Needed</b>

Mad honey is often marketed as ‚Äúorganic‚Äù or ‚Äútraditional,‚Äù misleading consumers into thinking it is safe. Retailers claim it boosts stamina or sexual performance, but the only proven effect is grayanotoxin intoxication. Because it is sold as a food or supplement, it falls outside most drug-safety laws. Without regulation, families remain at risk from products that can trigger life-threatening cardiac events after a single dose.

‚∏ª

<b>What You Can Do</b>

1. Ban the import, distribution, and sale of any product containing grayanotoxins or marketed as ‚Äúmad honey.‚Äù  
2. Classify grayanotoxin-containing honey as an adulterated food under state and federal law.  
3. Empower health departments and boards of pharmacy to issue public warnings and recalls.  
4. Require retail platforms and importers to verify the source and safety of honey products.  
5. Fund poison-control education so families and clinicians recognize and report mad honey poisoning.  

‚∏ª

<b>Closing</b>

No food or supplement should cause cardiac collapse or seizures after a single teaspoon. ‚ÄúMad honey‚Äù products pose a clear and avoidable public-health hazard. I urge you to support legislation that prohibits their sale and protects consumers from grayanotoxin poisoning.

Respectfully,
