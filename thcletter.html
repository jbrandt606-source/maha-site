To the Honorable Members of [State Legislature or U.S. Congress]:

As a concerned [parent / healthcare professional / citizen], I am writing to urge action to restrict or ban high-potency THC concentrates and hemp-derived THC analogs such as Delta-8, Delta-10, and THC-O acetate. These products are unregulated, easily available to minors, and responsible for a growing number of pediatric poisonings and emergency hospitalizations.

‚∏ª

<b>What Are THC Concentrates and Analogs?</b>

Delta-8 and related products are synthetic THC compounds created by chemically converting CBD extracted from hemp. Although marketed as ‚Äúlegal‚Äù and ‚Äúmild,‚Äù these analogs produce the same psychoactive and physiological effects as traditional THC, often at far higher concentrations.  
Laboratory testing has revealed products containing 60‚Äì95% THC, unlisted synthetic cannabinoids, heavy-metal contaminants, and residual solvents.

‚∏ª

<b>Public-Health and Pediatric Harms</b>

‚Ä¢ National poison-center data show hundreds of pediatric THC edible exposures each year, with sharp increases since 2020.  
‚Ä¢ Studies in 2023‚Äì2024 found that child hospitalizations doubled following retail expansion of Delta-8 products.  
‚Ä¢ Clinical toxicology data document confusion, loss of coordination, vomiting, and respiratory depression in children and teens.  
‚Ä¢ Pediatric research confirms that most exposures involve candy-like edibles or gummies labeled as hemp products.  
‚Ä¢ Laboratory analyses have detected mislabeled or counterfeit ‚Äúedibles‚Äù that contain Delta-8 or THC-O acetate far exceeding safe limits.  
‚Ä¢ Reports also describe unintentional ingestion by toddlers and severe intoxication requiring intensive care.  

‚∏ª

<b>Why Regulation or Bans Are Needed</b>

Because these analogs are synthesized from hemp, they exploit a loophole in the 2018 Farm Bill that legalized hemp with less than 0.3% Delta-9 THC. The law did not anticipate chemical conversion into potent psychoactive compounds. As a result, gas stations and vape shops are now selling high-dose THC edibles and vapes outside of any medical or recreational cannabis framework.  
Packaging frequently mimics brand-name snacks and candies, appealing to children. Product labeling is inconsistent, and there is no federal testing or age-verification requirement.

‚∏ª

<b>What You Can Do</b>

1. Clarify in federal and state law that all intoxicating THC analogs ‚Äî including Delta-8, Delta-10, HHC, and THC-O ‚Äî are controlled substances subject to the same rules as Delta-9 THC.  
2. Prohibit sales of THC analogs and concentrates in gas stations, vape shops, and convenience stores.  
3. Require clear labeling, testing, and child-resistant packaging for all cannabis products.  
4. Fund poison-control and hospital surveillance programs to monitor pediatric exposures.  
5. Support parent and school education campaigns on the risks of synthetic and high-potency THC.  

‚∏ª

<b>Closing</b>

No child should end up in an intensive-care unit from a candy-colored edible sold at a gas station. I urge you to act quickly to regulate or ban hemp-derived THC analogs and ensure consistent safety standards for all THC products.
