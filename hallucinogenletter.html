To the Honorable Members of [State Legislature or U.S. Congress]:

As a concerned [parent / healthcare professional / citizen], I am writing to request stronger regulation or prohibition of unapproved hallucinogenic products being sold in gas stations, smoke shops, and online under names like “microdose mushroom,” “Diamond Shruumz,” or “Amanita chocolate.” These products falsely market themselves as legal “wellness” items but contain psychoactive or toxic ingredients that have hospitalized children and adults across the United States.

⸻

<b>What These Products Are</b>

Retailers are selling gummies, chocolates, and vapes advertised as “mushroom” or “microdose” products that claim to contain psilocybin, muscimol, or other hallucinogens. Many are labeled as containing “Amanita muscaria extract,” an unapproved and toxic compound. Others falsely claim to provide “natural psilocybin,” which is a Schedule I substance. Laboratory analyses have found that these products are often mislabeled, adulterated, or contain synthetic psychoactives not declared on the packaging.

⸻

<b>Public-Health Risks and Documented Harms</b>

• The CDC has issued multiple health alerts after outbreaks of poisoning from “microdose mushroom” products.  
• The FDA has recalled several retail “mushroom edibles” after they caused hallucinations, panic, seizures, and hospitalizations.  
• State health departments have confirmed that “Diamond Shruumz” brand chocolates and gummies caused severe illness requiring intensive-care treatment.  
• Analyses of products purchased from smoke shops found they contained no psilocybin, but undisclosed active synthetic drugs.  
• Pediatric and adult emergency visits have increased for hallucinations, psychosis, and accidents related to mislabeled “mushroom” or “wellness” edibles.  
• FDA and CDC investigations found that many were being sold in vape and convenience stores next to hemp or Delta-8 products, without warning labels or age limits.  

⸻

<b>Why Action Is Needed</b>

Psychoactive mushroom products are being sold outside any legal medical or research framework. They are untested, misbranded, and dangerous. Consumers are misled into believing these products are “natural,” “therapeutic,” or “legal microdoses.” In reality, they contain toxic ingredients that can cause severe neurologic and psychiatric reactions. Current supplement and food laws do not cover these substances, leaving families unprotected.

⸻

<b>What You Can Do</b>

1. Ban the sale of any consumer product containing Amanita muscaria, muscimol, ibotenic acid, or synthetic hallucinogenic analogs.  
2. Classify such substances as adulterants under food and supplement laws.  
3. Require retailers and online sellers to remove unapproved “mushroom” or “microdose” products from shelves.  
4. Support federal and state coordination between FDA, DEA, and FTC to stop deceptive marketing and labeling.  
5. Fund public-education campaigns warning about the dangers of psychoactive mushroom products.  

⸻

<b>Closing</b>

Unregulated hallucinogen products are endangering families by being marketed as harmless wellness supplements. These products do not belong in gas stations or candy aisles. I urge you to take swift legislative and regulatory action to remove these items from the market and prevent further poisonings.
