To the Honorable Members of [State Legislature or U.S. Congress]:

As a concerned [parent / pharmacist / healthcare professional / citizen], I am writing to urge you to support legislation banning kratom (<i>Mitragyna speciosa</i>) and its active alkaloids. Kratom is not a harmless herbal product‚Äîit is an opioid-class drug with well-documented risks of addiction, dependence, and death.

‚∏ª

<b>Kratom‚Äôs Opioid Nature</b>

Kratom‚Äôs main alkaloid, mitragynine, is metabolized in the human body into 7-hydroxymitragynine (7-OH), a Œº-opioid receptor agonist several times more potent than morphine. Even if a product contains little 7-OH, the body produces it internally. Allowing kratom sales is effectively no different than permitting heroin precursors to be sold at gas stations.

‚∏ª

<b>Harm Data</b>
‚Ä¢ Overdose deaths: The CDC‚Äôs State Unintentional Drug Overdose Reporting System (SUDORS) identified over 1,000 kratom-positive deaths per year between 2020 and 2023 across more than 30 states.
‚Ä¢ Florida medical examiners have documented over 500 mitragynine-caused deaths since 2020.
‚Ä¢ Poison centers: The National Poison Data System (NPDS) recorded 10,272 kratom exposures between 2014 and 2023. Over half had serious medical outcomes, and nearly half required hospitalization.
‚Ä¢ FDA Adverse Events: The FDA‚Äôs FAERS database includes over 1,200 mitragynine cases with hundreds of deaths; additional CAERS reports describe severe hospitalizations.
‚Ä¢ Clinical case reports document respiratory depression, seizures, liver failure, and neonatal withdrawal in infants exposed in utero.
‚Ä¢ Contamination: The FDA has recalled kratom products contaminated with Salmonella, lead, nickel, and hidden drug ingredients.

‚∏ª

<b>Why Action Is Needed</b>

Kratom is marketed as a ‚Äúnatural‚Äù alternative for pain, anxiety, and opioid withdrawal‚Äîclaims the FDA has repeatedly deemed illegal. In reality, kratom causes opioid-like dependence and withdrawal symptoms, with documented fatalities.
Partial measures, such as banning only 7-OH, will not work; the majority of harm stems from kratom leaf and extracts, which the body itself converts into 7-OH.

‚∏ª

<b>What You Can Do</b>
1. Amend state or federal controlled-substances laws to classify <i>Mitragyna speciosa</i> and its alkaloids as Schedule I.
2. Prohibit retail and online sales of kratom and similar opioid-like products marketed as ‚Äúsupplements.‚Äù
3. Protect youth and vulnerable populations by removing kratom from gas stations, vape shops, and convenience stores.
4. Support education and enforcement funding for poison-control centers and local health departments.

‚∏ª

<b>Closing</b>

The opioid crisis continues to devastate families across the country. We cannot leave a gas-station opioid loophole open. Please act decisively to ban kratom and safeguard public health.
