  <h1>Nitrous Oxide (“Whippets”): What Parents Should Know</h1>

  <p>Quick facts in plain language, with reliable sources you can share.</p>

  <p><strong>It’s not harmless.</strong> Nitrous oxide can cause dizziness and loss of coordination, raising risks for falls and crashes.^{1,2}</p>
  <p><strong>Silent oxygen loss.</strong> Inhaling in enclosed spaces or with masks/bags can displace oxygen and cause hypoxia or asphyxia.^{1,3}</p>
  <p><strong>Nerve damage is real.</strong> Repeated or heavy use inactivates vitamin B<sub>12</sub>, which can lead to numbness, weakness, and difficulty walking from spinal cord/nerve injury.^{4–6}</p>
  <p><strong>Legal ≠ safe.</strong> Easy retail access (cartridges/balloons) has driven youth misuse spikes and medical encounters.^{1,6}</p>

  <h2>Parent Playbook</h2>

  <p><strong>What to watch for.</strong> Small silver “chargers,” piles of popped balloons, whipped-cream dispensers with no culinary use; sweet/metallic smell; unsteady gait; tingling in hands/feet.^{1,2}</p>

  <p><strong>Where it shows up.</strong> Gas/vape shops, parties, online vendors; often marketed as “laughing gas,” “whippets,” or “Galaxy Gas.”^{1,6}</p>

  <p><strong>What to do now.</strong> 1) Remove access; 2) Talk calmly (sample script below); 3) Call your clinician to discuss checking B<sub>12</sub> if there are symptoms (numbness, weakness, balance issues); 4) Never use in enclosed spaces or with masks/bags; 5) Don’t mix with alcohol/other drugs.^{1–3,5}</p>

  <p><strong>Emergency signs—seek care.</strong> Persistent numbness/weakness, trouble walking/using hands, severe headache/fainting, bluish lips, or cold-burns (frostbite) on lips/face.^{1,3,4}</p>

  <h2>Myths vs. Facts</h2>

  <p><strong>Myth:</strong> “It’s just a party balloon—can’t be that serious.”<br>
     <strong>Fact:</strong> Repeated use has been linked to nerve and spinal cord injury due to B<sub>12</sub> inactivation; recovery can be slow or incomplete.^{4–6}
  </p>

  <p><strong>Myth:</strong> “If there’s no smoke or pills, it’s safer.”<br>
     <strong>Fact:</strong> Inhaling gases can displace oxygen and cause hypoxia, falls, and accidents.^{1,3}
  </p>

  <p><strong>Myth:</strong> “A multivitamin fixes it.”<br>
     <strong>Fact:</strong> Functional B<sub>12</sub> inactivation may occur despite normal screening labs; medical evaluation matters.^{4–5}
  </p>

  <h3>How to talk about it (script)</h3>
  <p><em>“I care about your brain and your future. Nitrous can quietly damage nerves—even when you feel fine later. If you’ve tried it, I’m not here to punish you; I want to help you stay safe and get checked if needed. Let’s look at what doctors are seeing.”</em></p>
