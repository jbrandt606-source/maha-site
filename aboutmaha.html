  <h1 style="margin-top:0;">About MAHA • Mothers Against Herbal Abuse</h1>

  <blockquote>
    “Are we supposed to make America healthy again — or make America high again?”
    <br/>Our answer: teach families the facts and give communities the tools to protect kids.
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    MAHA exists to <b>educate parents, schools, and neighborhoods</b> about unregulated “herbal” drug products sold in
    gas stations, vape shops, and online — and to <b>empower communities to remove them</b>. We translate medical evidence
    into plain language, show what these products look like in stores, and provide ready-to-use letters, talking points,
    and action steps that work at the federal, state, and local levels.
  </p>

  <h3 style="margin:12px 0 6px;">What we do</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Parent education:</b> short, referenced guides that explain what the products are, how they harm kids, and what to watch for.</li>
    <li><b>Community tools:</b> form letters, meeting scripts, and store-owner one-pagers to start effective conversations.</li>
    <li><b>Policy primers:</b> simple “who does what” worksheets so families can ask the right agency to act.</li>
    <li><b>Visual evidence:</b> real-world packaging examples so caregivers can recognize candy-style marketing immediately.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 style="margin:12px 0 6px;">How you can use MAHA</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Learn:</b> open any topic in the Information Center and share it with your school, church, or PTA.</li>
    <li><b>Report:</b> when you see risky products, use our reporting links to notify health agencies and consumer-protection teams.</li>
    <li><b>Act:</b> send a form letter to your city council, state lawmakers, or Congress; bring the handouts to local meetings.</li>
    <li><b>Protect:</b> ask retailers to remove child-appealing packs; request warning signs or age checks in your town.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 style="margin:12px 0 6px;">Our mission</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Educate</b> every parent and caregiver with clear, evidence-based information.</li>
    <li><b>Equip</b> communities with practical tools to change policy and store practices.</li>
    <li><b>Eliminate</b> unregulated psychoactive products from places kids shop and play.</li>
  </ul>

  <p style="margin-top:12px;">
    When families know what’s on the shelf — and how to respond — communities get healthier. Together we can make
    America <b>healthy again, not high again.</b>
