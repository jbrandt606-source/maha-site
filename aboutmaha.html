  <h1 style="margin-top:0;">About MAHA • Mothers Against Herbal Abuse</h1>

  <blockquote>
    Are we supposed to "Make America Healthy Again" — or "Make America High Again”?
    <br/>For us, the answer is clear: we choose health, knowledge, and community.
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    MAHA was built on a mother’s instinct - that deep, unshakable belief that families deserve honesty, not harm, in the name of “wellness.” 
    Across the country, parents are finding gas stations and vape shops selling products that look like candy but act like drugs. 
    These stores sit right in our neighborhoods — near our schools, our playgrounds, our homes. 
  </p>

  <p>
    So we decided to do something about it. 
    MAHA is about <b>education and empowerment</b> — giving parents, teachers, and neighbors the knowledge and tools they need to protect their families and reclaim their communities.
    Because change doesn’t start in Washington — it starts at our kitchen tables, in our churches, and in the hands of people who care.

  <h3 style="margin:12px 0 6px;">What we believe</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Every parent has power.</b> You don’t need a title to make change — you just need to speak up.</li>
    <li><b>Education saves lives.</b> When we understand what’s being sold and why it’s dangerous, we can protect our children.</li>
    <li><b>Community is the antidote.</b> Real safety comes when we work together — parents, schools, and leaders — to demand better.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 style="margin:12px 0 6px;">Our mission</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Educate</b> families with clear, trustworthy information about unregulated “herbal” drugs.</li>
    <li><b>Equip</b> communities with ready-to-use letters, toolkits, and real data to hold retailers and lawmakers accountable.</li>
    <li><b>Empower</b> parents to take back their neighborhoods — one store, one conversation, one city council meeting at a time.</li>
  </ul>

  <p style="margin-top:12px;">
    Together, we’re building a movement rooted in knowledge, courage, and love for our children. 
    We believe that when families are informed, communities are strong — and when communities are strong, change is unstoppable.
  </p>

  <p><b>We’re MAHA.</b> And we’re here to make America <b>healthy again — not high again.</b></p>
