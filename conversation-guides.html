      <p style="max-width:700px;margin:0 auto;color:var(--muted,#b5c2de);">
        Kids see “herbal highs,” kratom, and gas-station products every day — on shelves that look safe. 
        This guide helps you turn those moments into calm, honest, and practical conversations that protect your family.

      <h2 style="margin-top:0;">Talking About Gas-Station “Herbal” Products</h2>
      <p class="muted" style="margin-bottom:12px;">
        These conversations don’t need to be awkward — they need to be real. 
        The goal isn’t to scare kids, but to make sure they know what’s out there, why it’s risky, and that they can always come to you with questions.
      </p>

      <div class="k-facts">
        <div class="k-fact">
          <p><b>Notice the moment.</b> If your child points out a product or asks about it, that’s your opening. 
          Try: “Yeah, I’ve seen those too — what do you think they are?”</p>
        </div>
        <div class="k-fact">
          <p><b>Ask curious questions.</b> Instead of “Did you try that?” ask “What have you heard about it?” or “Why do you think people buy them?”</p>
        </div>
        <div class="k-fact">
          <p><b>Share simple facts.</b> “Some of these products act like drugs, even though the label says ‘herbal.’ 
          A lot of them aren’t tested or approved for safety.”</p>
        </div>
        <div class="k-fact">
          <p><b>Talk about goals, not fear.</b> “You work hard to stay healthy — I’d hate to see something like this take that away.”</p>
        </div>
        <div class="k-fact">
          <p><b>Expect pushback.</b> If they say “It’s natural” or “It’s legal,” that’s okay. 
          Explain that “legal” doesn’t mean safe — and that many products are pulled from stores for safety issues.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="k-fact">
          <p><b>Keep it going.</b> These talks work best when they’re short and frequent. 
          A few calm conversations do more good than one big lecture.</p>

      <h3 style="margin:16px 0 6px;">Conversation Starters</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>“Have you ever noticed those colorful packets or drinks near the counter? What do you think they are?”</li>
        <li>“Why do you think something labeled ‘natural’ might still be risky?”</li>
        <li>“What would make someone want to try one of those products?”</li>
        <li>“If you saw a friend buy something like that, what would you think?”</li>
      </ul>

      <p style="margin-top:14px;">
        <b>Tip:</b> Be honest, listen first, and let curiosity lead. 
        These conversations build trust — and that trust keeps kids safe.
